# reloader.sh - automatically trigger a reload of a build/server process when a
# file change is detected.
#
# Theory of operation
# -------------------
#
# The main design decision of reloader.sh is to not be a long-running process
# in and of itself between reloads of the build and/or server process. Unlike
# other utilities that provide reloading which sit in a loop, waiting for file
# changes and restarting processes, reloader.sh waits for the first filesystem
# change event only. It then arranges for the the process or processes to be
# reloaded, and immediately re-execs itself. In this way, no long-running state
# needs to be managed, which can be finicky, or be subtlely modified in ways
# that can be hard to debug. A clean new process runs each time.
#
# Dependencies
# ------------
#
# reloader.sh does have one 3rd-party depedency other than bash 4.x, which is
# [fswatch][fswatch]. fswatch is a filesytem event notification utility that
# abstracts the differences between various operating system event mechanisms.
#
# [fswatch]: https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/
#
# Design goals
# ------------
#
#   * Simple operation
#
#   * Correctness - the tool should do the right thing with regard to shutting
#     down cleanly (i.e., stop all descendent processes that are created by the
#     main commands), and handle signals correctly (i.e., use Ctrl-C/SIGINT to
#     stop the reloader and propagate that signal correctly to the other
#     processes and controlling shell; similar correct SIGTERM behavior).
